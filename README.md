# Fishwatch

## Getting started

use `create-react-app`'s `typescript` template as a starting point:

```npx create-react-app fishwatch --template typescript```

## Goal

The goal of this test is to develop a simple, visually pleasing web app.  
This will enable us to get a better understanding of your programming skills and methodology.  

## Assignment

Build a single-page web app consisting of a grid layout of various fish that can be searched and filtered.  
For this you can use the free API `https://www.fishwatch.gov/api/species`  
More info can be found at <https://www.fishwatch.gov/developers>  

This application must have the following minimum features:

1) A grid layout containing the various fish. Each tile should show at least:
   1) One photo of the species
   2) The species name
   3) The harvest type. `Wild` and `Farmed` fish should have a visually different grid tile.
   4) Feel free to use other data fields if it suits your UI.

2) Search bar that filters the various fish based on their species name  

3) A select / dropdown to filter species based on harvest type (`Wild`, `Farmed`, or any)

4) Clicking on an individual tile should reveal some more information about the species. You are free to select the way this extra information is shown (e.g. modal, other "page", ..).

If you have some time left, you can add extra features or UI enhancements as desired.  
Just remember, this assignment should only take max. 2 hour of your time.
